## Hi everyone! 👋

I've been a professional developer since 15+ years and software architect since 5+ years.
My career is based on Java, its massive ecosystem of libraries as well as tools and other technologies based on the JVM.

I'm currently working as a software architect and team lead at [@msg-systems](https://github.com/msg-systems).
I'm especially interested in:

- 🏗️ designing system architectures,
- 📝 writing documentation,
- 💻 coding,
- 🤝 bringing together IT architecture and software engineering.

Personally I'm dabbling in other fields:

- 🧠 personal knowledge management with [Obsidian.md](https://github.com/obsidianmd),
- 🎮 game development with [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine),
- 🏡 home automation with [openHAB](https://github.com/openhab).

I'm looking on collaborating on aforementioned open source projects (and others) to support them as they've supported and inspired me.
