## Hi everyone! 👋

I'm a professional developer and software architect since almost 15 years.
My career is based on Java and related frameworks, especially the [Spring](https://spring.io/) ecosystem.

I'm working as a software architect and team lead at [@msg-systems](https://github.com/msg-systems).
I'm especially interested in:

- 🏗️ designing system architectures,
- 📝 writing documentation,
- 💻 coding,
- 🤝 bringing together IT architecture and software development.

Personally I'm dabbling in other fields:

- 🎮 game development with [@godotengine](https://github.com/godotengine),
- 🏡 home automation with [@openhab](https://github.com/openhab),
- 📷 photography.

I'm looking on collaborating on aforementioned open source projects (and others) to support them as they've supported me and my career.
